# pparser

pparser is [peg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parsing_expression_grammar) parser generator for C++.

## Features
- [x] generation of a parser in C++ code
- [ ] support for unicode
- [ ] support for various return types for rules
- [ ] support for left-recursive rules
- [ ] support for the Packrat parsing algorithm

## Usage
calc.peg:
```
%name calc

# comment
%type "int"
%root Sum

Value = a:[0-9]+ { $$ = std::stoi(a); }
Sum = a:Value _ "+" _ b:Value { $$ = a + b; }
_ = [ \t]*
```

generate parser:
```console
$ python pparser.py calc.peg
```
this will generate a .cpp and .hpp file with the parser implementation. The parser will be located within the namespace `PParser`. Now you can include it into your project and use it:

```cpp
#include "parser.hpp"

int main() {
    char str[] = "1 + 2";
    PParser::Parser parser(str); // create parser
    auto result = parser.parse(); // use it
    if (result.has_value())
        std::cout << result.value() << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

## Docs
### Comments
Comments start with the symbol #. Anything following # until the end of the line is considered a comment.
```
# this is a comment
```

### Directives
Directives begin with the symbol `%`. The directive can be undeclared, but if declared, it can only be declared once.

- `%name` - Specifies the names for the output .cpp and .hpp files. If not set, the name will be based on the input file's name.
```
%name calculator
```

- `%type` - The type that the parser will return, which can also be used for certain rules if a type is not specified but there is an action.
```
%type "std::string"
```

- `%hpp` - Inserts code at the beginning of the `.hpp` file.
```
%hpp {
    #include <iostream>

    struct Node
    {
        std::string value;
    }
}
```

- `%cpp` - Inserts code into the `.cpp` file.
```
%cpp {
    int main()
    {
        char str[] = "1 + 2";
        Pparser::Parser parser(str);
        auto result = parser.parse();
        std::cout << result << std::endl;
        return 0;
    }
}
```

- `%root` - Specifies the rule from which parsing will begin. If this directive is not specified, parsing will start from the first declared rule.
```
%root Statement

Value = [0-9]+
Statement = Value # starts from here
```

### Rules
Syntax:
```
<RuleName> = <parsing expressions>
```
- RuleName - this is the name of a rule, and it can consist of letters, digits, and underscores, but it cannot start with a digit. Names are case-sensitive.

- parsing expression - this is the expression being parsed. Separated by spaces, checked from left to right.

```
Rule = "1" "2" "3"
```

#### Parsing Expression
Consists of the following element:

- String - Ñ–s enclosed in double quotes, cannot be empty.
```
Rule = "string"
```

- Character class - this is a set of characters. It is enclosed within square brackets, matches only one character from the sequence, and cannot be empty. You can use a hyphen inside a character class to specify a range of characters. [0-9] matches a single digit between 0 and 9.
```
Rule = [abcd]
Hexadecimal = [0-9a-fA-F] # matches a single hexadecimal digit
```

- Another rule - invokes another rule.
```
Rule = SecondRule
SecondRule = "hello"
```

- Dot - matches any single character. Fails only when the input has ended.
```
AnyCharacter = .

```

#### Operators
Various operators can also be applied to the elements mentioned above:

- `&` - and-predicate. Look ahead into the input string without actually consuming it. True if it exists.
```
Rule1 = "hello" &" world"
```

- `!` - not-predicate. The same as an and-predicate, but true only if the element does not exist.
```
Rule = "hello" !" world"
EOF = !. # if use a not-predicate with dot, you can determine if the input has ended
```

- `*` - zero-or-more. Consumes zero or more occurrences of the element. Always true.
```
Numbers = [0123456789]*
```

- `+` - one-or-more. Consumes one or more occurrences of the element. True when consuming more than one element.
```
Numbers = [0123456789]+
```

- `?` - optional. Looks ahead for the element. If found, consumes it. Always true/
```
Rule = "hello" "world"?
```

- `()` - group. In essence, this is an anonymous rule. It executes expressions within itself. Becomes true if its contents are true.
```
Rule = "1" ("2" "3")
```

- `|` - the choice operator. Specifies alternative options. If the expression on the left succeeds, returns it; if not, moves to the expression on the right and executes it. If both expressions fail, returns false.
```
Rule = "foo" | "bar" | "baz"
Rule = [123456789] " " ("+" | "-" | "*" | "/") [123456789]

# You can also write an extra operator at the beginning for aesthetic purposes
Rule =
    | "foo"
    | "bar"
    | "baz"
```
